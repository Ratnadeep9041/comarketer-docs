# Live Code Preview: WebContainers vs. Sandpack vs. Manual Hosting

### WebContainers
- **What**: Browser-based Node.js runtime (by StackBlitz) that runs full npm projects in-browser, including server-side code.
- **Pros**:
  - True full-stack environment (can run backend code, npm scripts).
  - High fidelity: matches local dev experience.
- **Cons**:
  - Heavy resource usage; slower startup.
  - Limited browser support.
  - More complex integration.
  - Security sandboxing limits some features.
- **Suitability**: Best for full-stack demos or when backend code must run in-browser.

### Sandpack
- **What**: React component library (by CodeSandbox) for live-editable code previews. Runs code in an iframe sandbox, supports many front-end frameworks.
- **Pros**:
  - Lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate in React apps.
  - Secure: runs code in isolated iframe.
  - Supports live editing, file trees, and custom themes.
  - Good for front-end (React, Next.js, etc.) previews.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited to front-end code (no backend/server-side execution).
  - Some advanced features (custom bundlers, etc.) may require extra setup.
- **Suitability**: Ideal for front-end code previews, interactive documentation, and educational tools.

### Manual Hosting
- **What**: Build and deploy the generated code to a server (local or remote), then embed or link to the running site.
- **Pros**:
  - Full control over environment and deployment.
  - Can support any stack or custom requirements.
- **Cons**:
  - Slow feedback loop (build, deploy, reload).
  - Not interactive or live-editable.
  - Complex to automate for every user/project.
- **Suitability**: Best for production or persistent demos, not for instant previews.

### Why We Chose Sandpack
For CoMarketer, the goal is to provide instant, interactive previews of generated front-end code (React/Next.js) directly in the browser, with a live file tree and code editor. Sandpack offers:
- Seamless React integration.
- Fast, secure, and isolated code execution.
- Live editing and previewing of user-generated code.
- Minimal setup and resource usage compared to WebContainers.
- No need for backend/server-side execution in the preview.

**WebContainers** were not chosen due to their heavier resource requirements, complexity, and unnecessary backend support for our use case. **Manual hosting** was rejected due to its lack of interactivity and slow feedback.

**In summary:** Sandpack provides the best balance of speed, security, and user experience for live front-end code previews in this project.
